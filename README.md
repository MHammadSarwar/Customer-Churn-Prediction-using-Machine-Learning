# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, impacting revenue and long-term growth. This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to predict customer churn, enabling companies to take proactive actions to retain customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains customer details, service usage patterns, and churn labels. The key features include:

- **Demographics:** Age, gender, location, etc.
- **Account Information:** Subscription tenure, contract type, billing method.
- **Service Usage:** Monthly charges, total charges, usage patterns.
- **Churn Label:** Indicates whether the customer has churned.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - Visualize churn distribution.
   - Analyze correlations between features.
   - Identify key factors influencing churn.

3. **Feature Engineering:**

   - Create new informative features.
   - Perform feature selection.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation:**

   - Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
   - Use cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.
   - Evaluate models using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.**

5. **Model Deployment (Optional):**

   - Convert the best-performing model into a deployable format (e.g., Flask API, Streamlit, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost)
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Supervised learning techniques)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for implementation

## Results

- Identified key factors influencing customer churn.
- Achieved high accuracy and F1-score using optimized models.
- Provided actionable insights to reduce churn.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or execute the Python script to train the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CustomerChurn.ipynb
   ```
4. Modify parameters and retrain models as needed.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement deep learning models for improved predictions.
- Deploy the model as a web service.
- Integrate real-time prediction capabilities.
